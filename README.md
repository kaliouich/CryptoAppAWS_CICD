# Hi there! Welcome to my AWS CI/CD journey!

Happy coding!

## Week 1

# 🚀 AWS CI/CD Pipeline Setup 🚀

After diving deep into AWS services like ECR (Elastic Container Registry), CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and IAM roles, I’m excited to share my journey in developing a streamlined CI/CD pipeline! Below is a step-by-step outline of my process:

---

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

1. **AWS Access Creation:**  
   Generate an AWS Access ID and secret access key to utilize AWS CLI commands.

2. **Create ECR Repository:**  
   Set up an ECR repository for Docker images.

3. **Code Storage in CodeCommit:**  
   Use CodeCommit to store code from my GitHub repository.

4. **Build Process with CodeBuild:**  
   Integrate CodeBuild with the CodeCommit repository using a `buildspec.yml` file to define the build process.

5. **Build Execution:**  
   Initiate the build and ensure the Docker image is successfully pushed to ECR. I aim to minimize console use by leveraging the AWS CLI.

To put theory into practice, I utilized the **KodeKloud** playground and implemented all AWS CLI commands in a bash script. You can find the script in my GitHub repository: **[CryptoAppAWS_CICD](https://github.com/yourusername/CryptoAppAWS_CICD)**.

## ⚠️ Challenges Encountered

1. **CodeCommit Credentials Issue:**  
   Faced hurdles with AWS CodeCommit as the KodeKloud playground doesn’t allow the creation of Git credentials, complicating code transfer between GitHub and CodeCommit.

2. **Policy Permissions Error:**  
   Encountered access denied errors due to insufficient IAM user permissions for AWS CodeCommit when using my SSH public key.

   🔗 Check my experimental script: [Issue 2 Script](https://github.com/yourusername/CryptoAppAWS_CICD/aws_scripts/issue_2.sh)  
   ![PassRole Issue 2](./aws_scripts/imgs/PassRole_issue_2.png)

3. **Build Project Creation Error:**  
   Received an `AccessDeniedException` while creating the CodeBuild project due to the lack of `iam:PassRole` permission for the required service role.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

To tackle these challenges, I adapted my strategy by manually creating the CodeBuild project. My script now retrieves the CodeBuild role and assigns the **AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser** policy, enabling the `buildspec.yml` to successfully push the Docker image to ECR.
